Kubernetes services
i) kubernetes load balancing
ii) service discovery
iii) expose to world

note - service will allow us to acces the application outside the kubernetes cluster.

we can create service of three types
1) clusterIp - application can be accesed inside the cluster
2) Nodeport - application can be accessed inside the organisation
3) Loadbalancer - application can be accessed outside the world

Note - service is a method to attach it to many pods to acces the application outside the world.
pods - also called as backends

service not provides the network interface to access the application but also provides the policy to acces the pods.

Loadbalancer type service info.

1) Loadbalancer questions
i)is load balcner type service on;y restricted to cloude seervice
ans - ber metal lb implementation

2) if lb can do things for why use ingress controller

ingress controller will watch for ingress resources .

points to remember 
i) ingress resources will allocate ip address
ii) some of the loadbalancer can sit inside the load balancer or outside the loadbalancer
iii) An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
