Kubernetes services
i) kubernetes load balancing
ii) service discovery
iii) expose to world

note - service will allow us to acces the application outside the kubernetes cluster.

we can create service of three types
1) clusterIp - application can be accesed inside the cluster
2) Nodeport - application can be accessed inside the organisation
3) Loadbalancer - application can be accessed outside the world

Note - service is a method to attach it to many pods to acces the application outside the world.
pods - also called as backends

service not provides the network interface to access the application but also provides the policy to acces the pods.
